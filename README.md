# r/Place Clone
This repo is very broken for now
Feel free to help if you want

[Demo](https://rplace-clone.herokuapp.com/)

# Idea for the project
- Have a drawing board like r/place but for communities to use
- Have a theme for the board
- Very configurable

# Notes
- Not any ratelimit yet so if you want to end it for everybody go ahead
- I'm not the best at programming
- This is at the proof of concept stage (It's only been worked on for 2 days now)
- Images only update when you set the pixel for now (Just refresh the page for updating the image from others)
